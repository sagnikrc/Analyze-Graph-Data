Utilizing the dataset (bitcoin.csv), calculate the below:

1. Eliminate duplicate edges
2. Filter graph. Filter the graph edges to remove any edge whose edge weight is less than 5 (i.e., keep an edge if its weight is >= 5).
3. Find “important” node. Find node with highest weighted-in-degree, highest weighted-out-degree, and highest weighted-total-degree.
